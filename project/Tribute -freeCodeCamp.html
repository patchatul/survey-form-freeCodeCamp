    <ul>
      <li class="ul">A diet that consists of unlimited grass hay, vegetables, and small amounts of pellets</li>
      <li class="ul">Vitamin C supplementation, because guinea pigs cannot make their own vitamin C and depend on it
        from their diet</li>
      <li class="ul">Proper housing that avoids extreme heat or cold</li>
      <li class="ul">Safe and proper toys to entertain, enrich, and exercise your guinea pig
        Proper and routine veterinary care</li>
